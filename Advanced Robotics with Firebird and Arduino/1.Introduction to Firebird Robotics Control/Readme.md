# Waitron: the Smart Waiter

This is a college project report on "Waitron: the Smart Waiter" which was completed as a part of the coursework.

## Project Description

Waitron is a smart waiter robot that can autonomously navigate through a restaurant, take orders from customers, and deliver them to the kitchen. It is designed to reduce the workload of human waiters and provide faster and more accurate service to customers.

The project involved building a prototype of the robot using the Firebird V robot platform and integrating it with various sensors and communication modules such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and Sharp sensor. The syllabus of the project involved programming the robot using C/C++ and implementing features such as LED blinking, buzzer beeping, battery voltage monitoring, IR sensing, shaft encoder testing, and Sharp sensor reading.

The report provides a detailed overview of the project, including its objectives, methodology, design, implementation, testing, and results. It also includes a discussion on the challenges faced during the project and the future scope of the project.

## Requirements

To replicate the project, the following requirements are necessary:

- Firebird V robot platform
- Sensors and communication modules such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and GSM
- Programming environment and software toolchain for C/C++
- Required libraries and header files for the specific programs
