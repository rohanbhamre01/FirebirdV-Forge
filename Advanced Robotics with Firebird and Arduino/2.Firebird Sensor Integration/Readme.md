# Firebird Sensor Integration 

This folder contains the following programs for the Firebird robot:

- `FB5_blink`: A program to make the robot's LED blink.
- `FB5_buzzer`: A program to make the robot's buzzer beep.
- `FBV_Battery_voltage_meter`: A program to measure the robot's battery voltage.
- `FBV_Ir_sensor`: A program to read values from the robot's IR sensor.
- `FBV_ShaftEncoder_test`: A program to test the robot's shaft encoder.
- `FBV_Sharp_sensor`: A program to read values from the robot's Sharp sensor.
- `UART_tester`: A program to test the robot's UART communication.

Each program is provided as a separate source code file in C or C++ programming language, and can be compiled and uploaded to the Firebird robot using appropriate tools and software.
